# Executive Summary
One of the most important factor while weighing the success of a facebook cosmetic page is how many users are engaged with the page. It is not just Page Likes but over the time how many people have appreciated or not appreciated the content that is uploaded on the page. Engagement with any post is an important factor measuring how much the content uploaded is affecting and reaching people. Based on this, we have chosen "Lifetime people who have liked your page and engaged with your post" as our dependent variable and our goal is to predict this based on the other regressors. We would like to examine which are those factors affecting the success of the post by the people who have liked the page. We would like to examine what kind of post (link,video, photo, status), time. day, month and other various factors receives maximum or minimum engagement. Based on this analysis, marketers can choose what kind of content and at what particular time can get the maximum level of engagement and hence better marketing.
